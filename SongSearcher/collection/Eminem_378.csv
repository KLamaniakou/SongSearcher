"Eminem","Walk On Water/Stan/Love The Way You Lie (SNL Medley)","walk on water   skylar grey i walk on water but i ain't no jesus i walk on water but only when it freezes   eminem why are expectations so high is it the bar i set my arms i stretch but i can't reach a far cry from it or it's in my grasp but as soon as i grab squeeze i lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze into the dark i plummet now the sky's blackening i know the mark's high butter flies rip apart my stomach knowin' that no matter what bars i come with you're gonna harp gripe and that's a hard vicodin to swallow so i scrap these as pressure increases like khakis i feel the ice cracking because   skylar grey i walk on water but i ain't no jesus i walk on water but only when it freezes   eminem it's the curse of the standard that the first of the mathers discs set always in search of the that i haven't spit yet will this step just be another misstep to tarnish whatever the legacy love or respect i've garnered the rhyme has to be perfect the delivery flawless and it always feels like i'm hittin' the mark 'til i go sit in the car listen and pick it apart like this shit is garbage god's given me all this still i feel no different regardless kids look to me as a god this is retarded if only they knew it's a facade and it's exhaustive and i try not to listen to nonsense but if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence mission accomplished i'm not godsent nas rakim 'pac big james todd smith and i'm not prince so   skylar grey i walk on water but i ain't no jesus i walk on water but only when it freezes  post skylar grey 'cause i'm only human just like you making mistakes oh if you only knew i don't think you should believe in me the way that you do 'cause i'm terrified to let you down oh   eminem it's true i'm a rubik's  a beautiful mess at times juvenile yes i goof and i jest a flawed human i guess but i'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex pectations and meet 'em but first the speedom verse now big sean he's goin' too fast is he gonna shout or curse out his mom there was a time i had the world by the balls eatin' out my palm every album song i was spazzin' the fuck out on and now i'm gettin' frowned and clowned on but the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's deshaun am i lucky to be around this long begs the question though especially after the methadone as yesterday fades and the dresden home is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn the crowds are gone and it's time to wash out the blonde sales decline the curtain's drawn they're closin' the set i'm still pokin' my head from out behind and everyone who has doubt remind now take your best rhyme outdo it now do it a thousand times now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes and as i grow outta sight outta mind i might go outta mine 'cause how do i ever let this mic go without a fight when i made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine but when i do fall from these heights though i'll be fine i won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine but i'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'cause   skylar grey i walk on water but i ain't no jesus i walk on water but only when it freezes  post skylar grey 'cause i'm only human just like you i've been making my mistakes oh if you only knew i don't think you should believe in me the way that you do 'cause i'm terrified to let you down oh if i walked on water i would drown   eminem 'cause i'm just a man but as long as i got a mic i'm godlike so me and you are not alike bitch i wrote stan  stan   skylar grey my tea's gone cold i'm wondering why i got out of bed at all the morning rain clouds up my window and i can't see at all and even if i could it'd all be gray but your picture on my wall it reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad   eminem as stan dear slim i wrote you but you still ain't callin' i left my cell my pager and my home phone at the bottom i sent two letters back in autumn you must not've got 'em there probably was a problem at the post office or somethin' sometimes i scribble addresses too sloppy when i jot 'em but anyways fuck it what's been up man how's your daughter my girlfriend's pregnant too i'm 'bout to be a father if i have a daughter guess what i'ma call her i'ma name her bonnie i read about your uncle ronnie too i'm sorry i had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him i know you probably hear this every day but i'm your biggest fan i even got the underground shit that you did with skam i got a room full of your posters and your pictures man i like the shit you did with rawkus too that shit was phat anyways i hope you get this man hit me back just to chat truly yours your biggest fan this is stan   skylar grey my tea's gone cold i'm wondering why i got out of bed at all the morning rain clouds up my window and i can't see at all and even if i could it'd all be gray but your picture on my wall it reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad  love the way you lie   skylar grey just gonna stand there and watch me burn well that's all right because i like the way it hurts just gonna stand there and hear me cry well that's all right because i love the way you lie i love the way you lie   eminem i can't tell you what it really is i can only tell you what it feels like and right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe i can't breathe but i still fight while i can fight as long as the wrong feels right it's like i'm in flight high off her love drunk from her hate it's like i'm huffin' paint and i love her the more i suffer i suffocate and right before i'm about to drown she resuscitates me she fuckin' hates me and i love it wait where you going i'm leaving you no you ain't come back we're runnin' right back here we go again it's so insane 'cause when it's goin' good it's goin' great i'm superman with the wind at his back she's lois lane but when it's bad it's awful i feel so ashamed i snap who's that dude i don't even know his name i laid hands on her i'll never stoop so low again i guess i don't know my own strength   skylar grey just gonna stand there and watch me burn well that's all right because i like the way it hurts just gonna stand there and hear me cry well that's all right because i love the way you lie i love the way you lie i love the way you lie"
