"Drake","Alton Sterling Statement","i am grateful to be able to call america my second home last night when i saw the video of alton sterling being killed it left me feeling disheartened emotional and truly scared i woke up this morning with a strong need to say something  it's impossible to ignore that the relationship between the black and brown communities and law enforcement remains as strained as it did decades ago no one begins their life as a hashtag yet the trend of being reduced to one continues  this is real and i'm concerned concerned for the safety of my family my friends and any human being that could fall victim to this pattern i do not know the answer but i believe things can change for the better open and honest dialogue is the first step  my thoughts and prayers are with the sterling family and any family that has lost someone to this cycle of violence  be safe out there more life"
