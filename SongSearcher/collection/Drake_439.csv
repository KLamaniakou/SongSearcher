"Drake","ESPYs Conference Call","connor shell  youre so vocal about how much you care about your hometown of toronto and how much your friends and crew mean to you and the sense of responsibility you feel to put on for your city can you give any insight for what it must have been like for someone like lebron to make that decision and that ultimate responsibility  drake  yeah i mean i think that for the last week and a half ive probably been bothering lebron as much as the press has trying to figure out what his decision is going to be i think we were all extremely intrigued by what stage of his life hes in i dont think that theres a better way to deal with it than how he just did i think if we can give out an award at the espys for incredible essay writing i would definitely love to present that to him because i think what he just did was patriotic in its own way was courageous and was just to me i think its going to be one of the most historic things of our generation  im just honored to know him and glad that ive gotten to no pun intended witness this moment for sure i think its an incredible thing  i actually woke up kind of late today so im just catching on its a great feeling for me i cant wait to get off this call and call him myself and tell him how proud i am because hes been a friend of mine for a long time  shell  obviously youve joined saturday night live and weve had justin timberlake host the show are you going to take a more musical approach to the espys than what weve seen in the past  drake  i think obviously one of the talents that im able to bring to the espys is music but im just going to get up there and i want to just prepare a great night for people i think we have prepared an incredible night for people i definitely want to incorporate music but im not there to put on a strictly musicbased show yeah we definitely have some incredible pretapes yeah i think its just going to be a great night overall im there to deliver a great hosting job  shell  what makes the perfect espys host weve seen some amazing people like justin timberlake and john hamm and even lebron james what strikes the perfect balance between a sports fan and an entertainer  drake  well i think what makes a perfect espys host is obviously somebody that can fill the room with energy and joy for the people that are in the seats but i think most importantly what i bring is the fact that i feel that i know the room better than any host before me just because so many of these guys i have personal relationships with i think im going to be able to tap into some jokes that will be appreciated by my friends in the crowd and also the athletes that i dont know  to me its just about knowing the room that youre in and trying to have the right presence and trying to give these guys an incredible night which they deserve  shell  hosting a sports awards show what do you feel is musics role in sports  drake  well i said once in a rap song that deep down we want to be them and they want to be us as far as musicians and athletes go i think that when i speak to any of my friends that play sports theyre always super into music whether it be rap or other genres my dream in life or my other dream in life that ill obviously never achieve was to go to college and be recruited and play in the league so i think theyre synonymous in that way we inspire each other and i think thats what really ties music and sports together  shell  this is a question for the producer and if possible i have a followup for drake with the lebron news and the decision that was so successful for espn was there an actual attempt to get his announcement slated for the espys did anybody reach out were you close  maura mandt  no there was not an attempt to have that be there and with the decision it wasnt something we were looking to have that announcement be on the espys certainly if lebron wanted to announce on the espys i would have happily had him there i think what the espys is about is the sports world plays out over the year and then we find the right person to help put that into perspective and thats what you look for the host for  were going to be reflecting on the year and lebron is something that happened so it will definitely be something that well address in the show but just like in sports we dont try to make that news happen it unfolds  shell  drake in monologues hosts usually take jabs at those in attendance and a lot of times in hiphop thats kind of also a part of rap music and its always been do you see similarities to delivering jokes on stage whether it be metaphorically or outright in hiphop  drake  i think thats a funny question i think its a good fit i definitely think that hiphop is a little more malicious than what any host is going for i think were not trying to end peoples careers or make people feel bad in any way and thats kind of most of the time what problems in hiphop are about so our night like i said is about being funny and about giving these guys a great time and celebrating sports  so yeah i think there is definitely a difference though being clever with words is being clever with words so that is one advantage that any musician has or any great writer has but i think the end goals are a bit different  shell  youre also being aware of public perception for instance you instagrammed the meme of yourself playing soccer right and you so like you definitely have i dont know how to put it maybe a love triangle thing going on with skylar and shell probably be there can we expect a joke or where youll mention it like you did with snl when you did the whole dated rihanna thing everyone loved it so can we expect that now that youll be hosting the espys  drake  well i obviously dont want to give away the material but i do have a growing affection for skylar and im not sure shell be able to make it but im sure ill give you a treat if you enjoy my past references im sure if i havent done it already now that i know youre looking for it i might stick one in there for sure you never know  shell  one of the things about espn and the espys is the incredible amount of social media reaction there is during the shows and the buildup  today i dont know if you realize this but youve been the talk of social media because of the pictures that chris brown posted up i just wonder about your feelings on that and if you can tell us what that means  drake  well as far as the latter end of the question id rather not comment on it but i know that our goal is obviously the night of the espys to completely take over the internet for everything that we do to go viral and for people to enjoy days or weeks afterwards i think that is kind of the goal of anything in this day and age is to sort of have a life on the internet thats why im excited  weve been working hard like i said on the pretapes and on the monologue and on every aspect of the show just to make sure that it lives on past this night which i can 00 guarantee it will  shell  is cleveland your new favorite sports city how are you going to incorporate a wiggins manziel and lb james into your espy segment  drake  first of all id like to say that despite what everyone on the internet thinks i do not team jump ive been  in the past ive always supported the player and not the institution unless its the kentucky wildcats or the toronto raptors those are two teams that i will never stray from but what people have to understand whether it comes to soccer whether it comes to football or obviously basketball i have a lot of friends that play for a lot of different teams  so its not that im team jumping im just a supportive friend with the recent news of course im going to go  of course im going to go watch games in cleveland if not for lebron who like i said has been a brother to me for years i mean weve got three kids from toronto on one team plus we have manziel who again is part of our family and like a brother  so i definitely have to look into some real estate in cleveland and maybe make some trips this year i might have to go spend a month out of the year there and watch my guys do what they do best  but yeah like i said my teams will always forever be who they are but yes i will support the group that has shifted to cleveland i think that for cleveland a place that ive been time and time again touring i just think its going to be greet i really would love to see that city grow because theyre just a supportive group of people and it is a great place so im really excited  shell  so the espys is your second host gig this year snl was amazing by the way so is hosting something that youre trying to do more of or are you just working on more music you have a lot to write about now that youre a bachelor again  drake  well actually my status hasnt changed just to clear that up ive always been out here coasting but aside from that the espys is my main focus like snl when i commit to something i dont let my focus stray  so for maura to give me this opportunity to host i dont take it lightly i put everything on hold to be  to give the best performance that i possibly can at this awards show and then from there i have things coming up whether its the ovo fest or the tour with lil wayne which is a real thing which a lot of people dont know if its a real thing or not but its very real and its going to be very competitive and then from there ill figure out the next steps for me  im always working on new music but the espys is the main focus right now and well figure out whats next afterwards  shell  one thing we learned about you after hosting snl is youre a tremendous impressionist i personally loved the katt williams and lil wayne  with having so many friends and being friendly with people in the audience can we expect you to break out any impressions during the show   drake  yeah im actually excited to say that i definitely have incorporated impressions in my performance and that is something that i actually pride in that i studied for i love finding a character and getting into that character especially if i know the person or know their mannerisms or can really study their mannerisms so yes i will be doing impressions during the espys and theyre good im excited  theyre great  shell  are you bringing your lint roller  drake  oh yes i think ill probably have it somewhere around maybe i should i should bring it out on stage you shouldnt have said it on the call you should have anonymously sent that tip in maybe we would have used the joke no i think ill be lintfree that night ill have a stylist and hopefully there is no lint on any of my suit  shell  so we know that you wore some custom calvin klein outfits for your tour are you planning on the same fashion wearing any calvin klein suits and which stars are you in terms of sports world are you looking forward to what theyre going to wear  drake  im not exactly sure what brands im going to be wearing right now im sort of still like i said very focused on the show ill figure out the suit aspect probably next week and what particular designers ill be wearing but im more excited about the costumes and the sort of athlete outfits that ill be draped in for you all to admire so thats really what my main focus is but ill get my suits together im also excited to see what the athletes are wearing through the show because that can make for a joke in itself i might just cut to somebody and i wont have to say anything  shell  you have so many relationships with a lot of athletes is there anyone in particular that you havent met yet that youre looking forward to meeting or have any of your friends that youre with already given you any advice about hosting  drake  well i mean ive gotten a lot of well wishes from my friends you know one of my mentors who is not an athlete but obviously jamie foxx a previous host and a big reason why i asked to be a part of this just because that performance that he gave i believe he hosted twice or three times oh twice right it was inspiring to me for so many reasons because of how he incorporated music but how funny he was and how commanding his presence was so his mentorship and advice has been great to me is there anybody that im looking forward to meeting i mean yeah i was going to say ive never met skylar im sure it will be extremely awkward when i do but i guess that would be my answer if she manages to show up which she probably wont her boyfriend will probably tie her down to a chair or something but yeah if i ever get to meet her i probably owe her an apology right off the bat its been all in good spirits but yeah that is the one person id like to meet  just for that last person i also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music i want to meet that guy and just look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down yeah nick whatever his name is because he didnt win so thats how hes going to be remembered nick whatever his name is  shell  can you talk a little bit about the collaborative process in preparing for the awards and how many of the ideas are coming from you and how many are coming from the writing staff also if you think writing a joke is harder than writing a song  drake  oh very good double question well for the first part the collaborative process has been absolutely incredible we have such a great team from obviously the chief boss lady maura all the way down to the writers and everybody thats involved everyone involved has been incredible to work with weve been at it now for three months i think just on and off meeting and talking and brain storming as far as ideas being mine i am very happy and proud to say that a lot of the ideas that i submitted are what im going to be performing or delivering on wednesday night whether it be music jokes and pretaped pieces i was heavily involved in the input of what to deliver and how to deliver it  is writing a joke harder than writing a song i think that because of the way i write songs which is very honest raw emotion about my life i think that writing a joke becomes a little easier for me because its just a little more lighthearted than your average brooding drake song as the public would deem it  but yeah i mean all my music is so honest that sometimes its hard to tap into that and be that honest with yourself when youre able to be lighthearted and joke around i enjoy it it comes a little quicker than songs do  mandt  id like to make a comment on the collaboration process having worked on the show a number of years one of the things that really resonates in the content is when its authentic from the person delivering it being able to have the access weve had to drake from the first time we met and spoke and had his input on whats coming up with stuff that he wants to do and us being able to go back and contribute and have them come to life it really elevates it so its definitely been a collaborative process on his end and being involved  we had a shoot the other day from one of the skits and on set he was coming up with stuff and you guys will see it and know what im talking about when you see the show but there was no script in certain areas of it it was really like an improv session and it was one of the greatest things to be able to see im really excited to have that be seen by everyone on the show"
