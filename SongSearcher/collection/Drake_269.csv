"Drake","2016 MTV VMAs Vanguard Award Intro for Rihanna","the first time the first time i met robyn fenty was 005 she was shooting a music video at a restaurant called avacado in toronto the song was pon de replay and the director and the director of the video was little x i was duced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner it's hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called work  today the world knows little x as director x they know me as drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta but eleven years later they still know rihanna as the one and only rihanna  captivating from day one the iconic being that is rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going for them that's often the peak but for her that was a starting point as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since  when it comes to music she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release when it comes to performances they swarm in masses just to be in her presence obviously and when it comes to fashion and style she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself which is when it gets a little awkward  what's most impressive isn't the endless list of stats awards and accomplishments what's most impressive is the person some artists need to play a character to achieve success some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in she succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does which is being herself  this woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from barbados surrounded by the same friends speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless it's to come and perform at ovo fest we love the music which can change styles from album to album we love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year but most of all we love the woman who hasn't changed since day one  she's someone she's someone i've been in love with since i was  years old she's one of my she's one of my best friends in the world all my adult life i've looked up to her even though she's younger than me she's a living breathing legend in our industry ladies and gentlemen the recipient of the michael jackson vanguard award for 06 rihanna"
