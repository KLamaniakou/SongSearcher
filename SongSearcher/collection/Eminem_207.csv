"Eminem","Foolish Pride","eminem  manix yo man yo marsh man yo you've been kickin' all this shit about yourself what of the homies man oh you want one about the posse alright   eminem ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride  verse eminem well foolish pride has a lot of things to say you got foolish pride like you got tooth decay but tooth decay is another problem so let's take this ole foolish pride problem and solve it now when i talk about foolish pride i mean blacks and whites taking different sides when blacks and whites take different sides unity never happens and we will subside we will subside and hatred will release and everything will just crush that peace but when we crush that peace you see we start hatin' each other but remember you are my brother and you are my sister just like i'm a mister i seen a black girlfriend and i kissed her i kissed her i placed it on her cheek and she didn't come back 'til next week now it was next week and she was back again wanting to kiss a white kid so she was my girlfriend we started going out but that's okay because we were black and white blacks and whites sometimes mix but black girls only want your money 'cause they're dumb chicks so i'ma say like this don't date a black girl take it as a diss if you want but if you don't i'ma tell you like this i surely won't never date a black girl because blacks only want your money and that shit ain't funny so i'ma say look honey why do you do this you know you step up to me like you a brutus then you try to grab my spinach because it's green and that's cash so get outta here 'cause i don't need your ass i said that before but that's okay because like i said you're a whore black girls and white girls just don't mix because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks white girls are good i like white girls i like white girls all over the world white girls are fine and they blow my mind and that's why i'm here now telling you this rhyme 'cause black girls i really don't like we don't mix it's like riding a bike when you're peddling hard uphill both ways you know it's kinda hard and that's why i say to you i'm giving you a little advice don't date a black girl if you do it once you won't do it twice you won't ever do it again because they'll take your money and that ain't funny so i'ma say look honey i've already said that before but like i said again you're nothing but a big whore so when mike catch on the bass line that's okay 'cause we will not just waste time i'll get straight to the point black girls are bitches that's why i'ma tell you you better pull up your britches 'cause all that cash is making your ass drag from the boyfriend you ganked and that's pretty bad i mean that's pretty sad when you're dating a black guy and then you turn around and fuck another big black guy now that's pretty wrong but you're just ganking but that's okay because you need a god damn spanking from me the funky mm i'm busting rhymes and i'm swallowing phlegm i'm busting a freestyle just like this i say swallowing phlegm and howard gets pissed but when howard gets pissed that's okay because he leaves and he doesn't show up for two more days so i'll just worry about that problem when i come to it i'll cross that  when i come to it 'cause i forgot the  but that's okay 'cause y'all saying bust a rhyme for us so i'ma bust another rhyme about this black girl she turned out to be a fuckin' wack girl a wack girl because black girls ain't funny all they want is your goddamn money they take you for everything you've got and then you stand with a bunch of snot in your hand so i'ma kick it to you just like this how does the  go i forgot but that's okay 'cause i'ma tell you in stride i'ma say ole foolish pride   eminem ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh date a white girl 'cause they got the raw hide"
