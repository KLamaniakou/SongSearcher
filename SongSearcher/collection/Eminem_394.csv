"Eminem","Cut Back","verse i cut back on the syllables just a little but still i feel i should killâ€…aâ€…few just toâ€…show that still i do putâ€…forth an effort one foot forward thank heavens and good lord whoever would've thought that my umbilical cord would've been ccutcut from the sssame cloth there's no other name just be thankful that i came forth temper the same whether it's boiled or flame broiled you say my name you bet that ass you gon' pay for it just the respect is not the crown that i came for but if you feel like passin' it around well then jay throw it 'cause we all go straight toward it if not i just wait for it the other skateboard got a couple of scrapes forget about it i'm stuck in this rut but i'll get up out it i always do i ain't gon' sit here and argue about it i can't hop out of that gutter i just crawl through up out it i'm back i'm sorry i feel awful about it"
