learn how to poison squirrels but first i'd like you to meet my friend bob huh say hi bob hi bob bob's thirty and still lives with his mom and he don't got a job 'cause bob sits at home and smokes pot but his twelveyearold brother looks up to him an awful lot and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot and wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks ahh and even if they escaped and they got the cops the ladies would all be so afraid they would drop the charge 'til one night mrs stacey went off the job when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk but stacey knew it was bob and said knock it off but bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker crazier than slim shady is off the vodka you couldn't even take him to dre's to get bob a doctor he grabbed stace' by the legs as he chopped it off her and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her but ever since the day stacey went off to wander they never found her and bob still hangs at the waffle diner and that's the story of bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you so see if the squirrels want itit's bad for you   see children drugs are bad come on and if you don't believe me ask your dad ask him man and if you don't believe him ask your mom that's right she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time she will so kids say no to drugs that's right so you don't act like everyone else does uhhuh and there's really nothin' else to say sing along drugs are just bad mmkay   my penis is the size of a peanut have you seen it fuck no you ain't seen it it's the size of a peanut huh speakin' of peanuts you know what else is bad for

don't get attached or it'll attack every bone in your back meet zach twentyone years old after hangin' out with some friends at a frat party he gets bold and decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys and the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it suddenly he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive and his eyes roll back in his skull blblblblblb his back starts to look like the mcdonald's arches he's on donald's carpet layin' horizontal barfin' bleh and everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him hey adam zach is a jackass look at him 'cause they took it too so they think it's funny so they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting their money meanwhile zach's in a coma the action is over and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga and that's the story of zach the ecstasy maniac so don't even feed that to squirrels class 'cause it's bad for you   see children drugs are bad that's right and if you don't believe me ask your dad that's right and if you don't believe him ask your mom you can she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time she will so kids say no to drugs don't smoke crack so you don't act

fungus it grows from cow manure they pick it out wipe it off bag it up and you put it right in your mouth and chew it yumyum then you start to see some dumb stuff and everything slows down when you eat some of 'em and sometimes you see things that aren't there like what like fat women in gstrings with orange hair mr shady what's a gstring it's yarn claire women stick 'em up their behinds go out
