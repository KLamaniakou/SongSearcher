"Eminem","The Apple","i'm a little nutty and i know it but if you go back and take a look at my history you will see that i am not the only one who's off his rocker there were many before me i was always labeled the black sheep of the family what a bad seed i'd grow to be but if you take a look at us now you'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree  interlude haha haha haha haha alright look i'mma tell you the story from my side maybe you'll understand check it out   you done witnessed unexplainable shit too insane to explain people run from what they just don't get maybe shady should have just hit 'em with a little bit did i spit too soon should i have spoon fed 'em it but i was just so eager to prove i was even worth bein' in the same league or the room of the people of whom i was in every now and then i look up like i was seekin' approval was it because of the pigment of my skin or was it a figment of my imagination maybe it bothered me more than it did them maybe it wasn't a big deal back then but to me it was see what it was was i had developed a complex from being judged proof spit his verse now i'm next let's see who balks i'm in the booth staring back to see whose mugs i get a reaction from usually the first thumb was from proof and the rest of the crew backed him up and no one lied to each other 'cause none of us had deals it was real we just wanted tickets for that meal   sometimes i feel like it's just me sometimes i feel like i'm goin' crazy but take a look at my family 'cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree i said sometimes i feel like it's just me sometimes i feel like i'm goin' crazy but take a look at my family 'cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree   ever since my mother was pregnant with a second egg 'cause she said that i had a baby sister who fell out of the window i was too young to remember kansas city projects i was like fivesix and how come i remember malcolm isaac and boogy if it was the projects in missouri 'cause those were my best friends until isaac took my tricycle and my uncle todd went to try to go get it back and ended up gettin' jumped and cut in the gut with a switch and seventysome stitches which is to this day why my mother still tries to show me some old fake picture of a fictitious little sister who never existed and this is why a part of my life's so twisted but i can never be as sick as that bitch is and by the way that picture's one of my relatives   sometimes i feel like it's just me sometimes i feel like i'm goin' crazy but take a look at my family 'cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree i said sometimes i feel like it's just me sometimes i feel like i'm goin' crazy but take a look at my family 'cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree   you probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain to see why everything i say is so insane what's different about my brain that separates me from other players in this game on the surface it may seem like a scheme or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy but that's the last thing i need is for people to walk around feelin' sorry for me and i am not a g never claimed to be i gave my vest to cashis just hope he don't need it more than me but we'll see 'cause we ain't lookin' for beef but if it comes our way what do we turn the other cheek come on   sometimes i feel like it's just me sometimes i feel like i'm goin' crazy but take a look at my family 'cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree i said sometimes i feel like it's just me sometimes i feel like i'm goin' crazy but take a look at my family 'cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree   yeah and i'm the crazy one right whatever then let me be the crazy one balalalalalalalalalala cuckoo cuckoo tweet"
