"Drake","I Do (Remix Verse)","uh please put away the cameras cause we just in the club getting mc hammered and god forbid we ever trade our wisdom for the glamor and i know that i'm just a boy that a woman can make a man of so make me one i know that you can make me one i just want a woman that looks 0 when she's 8 please don't give it all away i hope that you can save me some the more they pass they heart around the more jaded that they become but this one's special so i make sure that my suit'll fit the one my daddy wore in june of 85 i'm too legit i'm just trying to get her in the mood and have her doing all the things she'd only do when she get married so let's do this shit tell the reverend all we're missing is his blessing because before she pop the pussy she need me to pop the question so we exchange vows they clap we take a bow and she'll be doing tricks for daddy when we take it to the house"
