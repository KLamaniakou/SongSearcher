"Ariana Grande","Feminism (Quotes)","when will people stop being offended by women showing skin  expressing sexuality men take their shirts off  express their sexuality onstage in videos on instagram anywhere they want to all the time the double standard is so boring and exhausting with all due respect i think it's time you get your head out of your ass sic women can love their bodies too  responding to a commenter who said she was like a whore in her dangerous woman video on facebook  the incredible double standard that we women face on a daily basis in the industry and just in the world it's shocking i would be so amused and pardon me if this comes across as sexist but i don't think a male artist would be in this position right now sorry if i'm speaking about something that i'm passionate about i'm willing to take the brunt for fighting in what i believe in and my fellow women are definitely something that i will always be one of the first to speak up about  is this what you think girls have trouble choosing between  is this men assuming that that's what girls would have to choose between  you need a little brushing up on equality over here  i have a long list of things i'd like to change  i think judgement in general intolerance meanness double standards misogyny racism sexism you know all that shit there's lots we've got to get started on that's what we need to focus on we've got work to do  responding to the question if you could use makeup or your phone one last time what would you pick on california's power 06 fm  i'm tired of needing to be linked to a guy i'm not big sean's ex i'm not niall's new possible girl i'm ariana grande  to the sun  what i meant when i said what i said about not being sean's ex is that i am tired of living in world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past present or future property  possession i  do not belong to anyone but myself and neither do you  i can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating married attached to having sex with or not seen with  but by their value as an individual   people are so ignorant sometimes stop trying to make people feel badly about their bodies it's okay to be different  to be curvy or to be thin when did it become socially acceptable to comment on what you think is 'wrong' with other people's bodies we were having fun dancing on stage 'what's she shaking tho' i'm shaking my pretty cute petite ass next to nicki's pretty big booty both are fing awesome how about we respect people's body boundaries and encourage each other to feel like a babe no matter how they are that would be nice so tired of watching everyone try to tear each other down  on instagram  gloria steinem published an article in 969 titled 'after black power women's liberation' and 46 years later  we're still not quite there yet if a woman has lots of sex or any sex for that matter  she's a 'slut' if a man has sex  he's a stud a bossssss a king if a woman even talks about sex openly  she is shamed but if a man talks or raps freely about all the women or more commonly used 'bitches'hoes'  how lovely he's had  he is regaled if a woman is seen with a friend with a penis there is immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled if a man is seen with a woman his status is elevatedcelebrated  on twitter"
