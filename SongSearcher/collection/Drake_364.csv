"Drake","Pianist Hands","thank you ms graham for coming today you look very nice today sorry that's not professional i guess they say in canada don't mingle business with pleasure or something like that so we have to talk about aubrey or how he likes to be called drake as i always like to say there is room for improvement in his learning from piano he talks a lot huh he socialize when i'm teaching okay and when it's time for him to play he doesn't have pianist hands if you need example me mozart and ray charles all of us have pianist hands i'm the only one living with this hands i guess heh i'm kidding i'm just kidding umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason but there is so much room for improvement you know speaking of improvement i don't think you ms graham need any of it heh i'm kidding i'm just kidding haha"
