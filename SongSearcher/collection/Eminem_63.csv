"Eminem","Kings Never Die","produced by the new royales   gwen stefani here to stay even when i'm gone when i close my eyes through the passage of time kings never die   eminem i can hear the drummer drummin' and the trumpets someone's tryna summon someone i know something's comin' but i'm runnin' from it to be standing at the summit and plummet how come it wasn't what i thought it was was it too good to be true have nothin' get it all but too much of it then lose it again did i swallow hallucinogens cause if not where the hell did it go cause here i sit in lucifers den by the dutch oven just choosing to sin even if it means i'm sellin' my soul just to be the undisputed again do whatever i gotta do just to win cause i got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head crown around it thorns on it cracks in it bet you morons didn't think i'd be back did ya how 'bout that im somehow now back to the underdog but no matter how loud that i bark this sport is somethin' i never bowout at i complain about the game i shout and i pout it's a lovehate but i found out that i can move a mountain of doubt even when you bitches are countin' me out and i appear to be down for the count only time i ever been out and about is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt cause i been lost tryna think of what i did to get here but i'm not a quitter gotta get up give it all i got or give up spit on shit on stepped on but kept goin' i'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like i slept on my neck wrong cause you're moving onto the next but is your respect gone cause someone told me that   gwen stefani kings never die   eminem don't give me that sob story liar don't preach to the choir you ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep nobody ever handed me shit in life not even a flyer wouldn't even take shit into consideration obliterate anyone in the way i think i see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me but it'd actually have to be a fuckin' blowout to get me to retire tell these new artists that kings never die i know shit has changed in this age fuck a twitter page did it just say i've been upstaged why am i online it's driving me crazy i'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge on what's hot but i'm not one to conform but as days pass in this shit and opinions sway i can hear 'em say if i stay passionate maybe i can stage a miraculous comeback as if i went away but detractors just say so much for the renegade someone's gonna make me blow my composure here i go again center stage and i feel like i'm in a cage they so want a champion to fall it's no wonder why i laugh at 'em cause why can't we win 'em all so fuck what these cynics say it just goes to show that when my back's against the wall and i'm under attack again that i'll act as if i'm 'posed ta with this pentup rage cause all these plaques in my office on the floor stacked against the door are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again cause all the accomplishments accolades awards and trophies just don't mean jack anymore if i'm here today and gone tomorrow and i'm not gonna be   gwen stefani here to stay even when i'm gone when i close my eyes through the passage of time kings never die   eminem i want it i'm comin' to get it so you son of a bitches don't duck youre gonna get riddick bowed critics'll end up in critical think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked and i ain't stopping 'til i'm on top again all alone and on a throne like a token of respect or a homage poem or an ode i've been owed tossed in the air by my own arm and launched so hard it broke my collarbone and when it's my time to go i'm still not leaving stop for no one i don't know but i've been told an obstacle that blocks your road ya knock it over time to go for the pot of gold cause   eminem they say kings never die just ask jam master jay they just grow wings and they fly so hands up reach for the sky try to hold on and prolong these moments cause in a blink of an eye they'll be over  4 eminem so you're tryna secure your legacy like shakur and ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were so before you're leavin' this earth you want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk deacon of words syllable genius at work plus i'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness kill 'em with meanness i went from powdered milk and farina to flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts at gilbert's to arenas call me gilbert arenas still appeal to the dreamers i made it to the silverscreen but rocky's still what the theme is khalil on the beat cause makin' the beat aint the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is it's that soundbombing thirstin howl common underground diamond d outsidaz stomach growl throbbin' hunger outrhymin' everyone god just give me one shot i swear that i won't let you down i'ma be around foreverandaday even in the ground you ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say i ain't   gwen stefani here to stay even when i'm gone when i close my eyes through the passage of time kings never die   gwen stefani kings never die"
