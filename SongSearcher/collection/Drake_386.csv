"Drake","Tough Day at the Office [Rolling Stone Apology]","with today being the 5th anniversary of so far gone i figured it's fitting to return to it's place of its origin in order to clear the air about an extremely emotional day i completely support and agree with rolling stone replacing me on the cover with the legendary phillip seymour hoffman he is one of the most incredible actors of our time and a man that deserves to be immortalized by this publication my frustration stemmed from the way it was executed the circumstances at hand are completely justifiable on the magazines behalf but i was not able to salvage my story or my photos and that was devastating they ran the issue without giving me a choice to be in it or not i would have waited until it was my time because i understand the magnitude of the cover they chose but i just wasn't given that option and that made me feel violated i apologize to anybody who took my initial comments out of context because in no way would i ever want to offend the hoffman family or see myself as bigger than that moment i am still the same person today i was forced out of my character and felt the need to react swiftly these days are the worst ones waking up after a great night in the studio and it's your day to be picked apart after dwelling on it for a few hours or days you will come to the conclusion that you brought it on yourself almost every time so here i am having that moment i once again apologize to everybody who took my cover comments the wrong way i respect rolling stone for being willing to give a kid from toronto a shot at the cover i guess this is a day to learn and grow  sincerely  the boy"
