"Drake","Come Real","drake  i always wonder why you bother putting makeup on you don't need it and even though i always tell you that you're beautiful i'll repeat it cause i don't want no singer i don't want no model and i don't want no fashion designer or nothing i just want your love i promise you that's more than enough for me  all you gotta do is come real shawty what the deal dont think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal i wouldn't have it any other way x   kyoko  baby just because i wanna look good don't mean that i ain't real not in the least bit all the clothes and doing of my hair face nails make me feel good and i'll keep it up im not sayin what you been stayin to me ain't exactly what i need to feel and know you're the one i'm wearing for and where i'll always go when i need a real love  kyoko  so stay real what you make me feel is true beauty of the ultimate appeal and i don't want it any other way x"
