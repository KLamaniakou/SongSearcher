made a fool out of when i pull on 'em r kelly with a full bladder r kelly with a full bladder nonhigh school grad i'm not a scholar but i'm so cold when i'm droppin' knowledge my degrees is the same as i got in college zero but nobody's hotter you owe me my respect i owe you nada like haloti partner blow me told you i'm so dirty homie you can throw me in some holy water with some floaties on and

uhhuh i get why you're tapped but you gotta get your fire back catch fire get upset and fire back is what i tell myself when times get bad 'cause sometimes i might get sad but i take the same advice i had and tell myself like i used to tell hailie when life's a drag told her to do like her dad don't cry get mad 'cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags i'm hyper by the time you see this side of me i'm right in your ass sodomy foot up it i stood up for the kid who had to put up with the bullies at his school at his school you ain't had to have no money or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude attitude now my dough's amountin' to a mountain that's rised too high to count it never asked to be rich all i did was wish i had a dime for every time that i was doubted but then i think about it then i'm enraged 'cause i just figured out that if i was paid for the time i spent to put the pen to the page it'd be minimum wage minimum wage but it's embedded in my head i never hunted for the bread and butter what i wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but i'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood i put up in the pen and when i'm dead i wonder will they put me on a pedestal or forget i was ever this incredible i guess i better go harder than ever 'cause i'll never get another motherfuckin' opportunity again to offend as many people with this i can simply because i can   eminem  kent jones 'cause nobody likes me everybody hates me they want me to go eat some worms i hope you offended and drag my name through the mud through the dirt but i'ma make you
