"Eminem","Letter to Tupacâ€™s Mother","dear afeni  sorry if it looks a little sloppy i could've done a little better if i had the right pencils instead i had to draw it in pen plus i just kind of thought of the idea a little too late but i've been drawing since i was 0 and i thought you might like it anyways thank you for always being so kind to me you are a true queen and i mean that in every sense of the word i will never forget the opportunities you have given me you will always be in my heart my thoughts and my prayers as i have said before you have no idea how much your son and his music has inspired not only the hip hop world but speaking for myself has inspired my whole career he was and still is the true definition of a soldier when i was feeling at my worst before fame before dre i knew i could put that pac tape in and suddenly things weren't so bad he gave me the courage to stand up and say fk the world this is who i am and if you don't like it go fk yourself thank you for giving us his spirit and yours god bless you  love  marshall"
