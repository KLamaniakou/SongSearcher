to thicken i begin to spittin' like vintage pac demented demonic sinister ever since the doc' replenished me the day he gave me that shot when i was just about to quit so to not see him with me would be a shockin' image and i'm the definition of what a concrete chin is cause no matter how many times you sock me in it and knock me to the canvas even the boxin' critics know that if i get off to a rocky start i'll always have a rocky finish eat me broccoli spinach cocky nope but i hope i offended you when i told ya how dope i am at this and put emphasis on the dope so when names come up in that conversation of who's the dopest better throw mine in it and don't mind me while i remind you of the flow you won't find anywhere when it fires and i unload my pen explodes 'til there's no rhymes in
