"Eminem","Victory (Remix)","eminem 'til i collapse i'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em 'til the day that i drop you'll never say that i'm not killin' 'em cause when i am not then i'ma stop pennin' 'em and i am not hiphop and i'm just not eminem subliminal thoughts when i'ma stop sendin' 'em women are caught in webs spin 'em and hock venom adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop amoxicillin's just not real enough the criminal copkillin' hiphop villain a minimal swap to cop millions of pac listeners you're comin' with me feel it or not you're gonna fear it like i showed you the spirit of god lives in us you hear it a lot lyrics to shock is it a miracle or am i just product of pop fizzin' up fa shizzel my wizzel this is the plot listen up you bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a fuck   eminem music is like magic there's a certain feelin' you get when you real and you spit and people are feelin' your shit this is your moment and every single minute you spend tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again so while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can and when your run is over just admit when it's at its end 'cause i'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in i got a list here's the order of my list that it's in it goes reggie jayz pac and biggie andrÃ© from outkast jada kurupt nas and then me but in this industry i'm the cause of a lot of envy so when i'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me that's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me you hate it but you know respect you got to give me the press's wet dream like bobby and whitney  nate hit me   eminem soon as a starts i eat at an mc's heart what is he thinking how not to go against me smart and it's absurd how people hang on every word i'll probably never get the props i feel i ever deserve but i'll never be served my spot is forever reserved if i ever leave earth that would be the death of me first cause in my heart of hearts i know nothin' could ever be worse that's why i'm clever when i put together every verse my thoughts are sporadic i act like i'm an addict i rap like i'm addicted to smack like i'm kim mathers but i don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers so this is like a fullblown attack i'm launchin' at 'em the track is on some battlin' raps who wants some static cause i don't really think that the fact that i'm slim matters a plaque and platinum status is whack if i'm not the baddest so   eminem yo yo yo yo"
