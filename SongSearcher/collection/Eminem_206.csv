bombing but we got something in common what both of us are alarming foul disgusting and awful yeah so repugnant and ugly yup i could give the boston marathon a run for its money yeah and you could say i'm a little bit immature but this type of literature got me a little richer but i get insecure when them other dudes hit on you girl you're letting 'em fiddle with your clitoris remember you were my fucking   ty dolla ign you used to be my favorite bitch things'll never be the same ain't it funny how you changed up and flipped the script you done let a bunch of lames fall through and go plain that i can't permit you ain't have to do it like that told you i'd be right back look what you did i need a new chick like the music i have to bounce on my favorite bitch   eminem eminem  ty dolla ign always hated my smile mama told me it's goofy i'd get picked on at school come home and she'd school me she never sugarcoated it to me she said if i wasn't so stupid and ugly i wouldn't always get bullied true i think of my struggles yeah and get emotional could be 'cause how behind the eightball and far in the hole that they put me now i'm on a roll like a tootsie yeah i'm just trollin' you pussies but i'm like a stroller 'cause you'll see just how i roll if you push me but that's what i do this music for when i was goin' through some of the hardest times i drew from her but she's like the devil 'cause i just can't let loose of her lucifer 'cause the thought of losin' her makes me wanna just let loose on her then i hit the studio tryna rendezvous with her tell her it's a buttdial

now that everything has changed yeah it'll never be the same nah as the era whence we came who from nas to pac ra yeah eric b and kane i know but i know a few from this era that are lyrically insane and although most are never gonna hit the level cole or weezy at or be emotionally attached to yo mtv raps yeah runnin' home from school to catch an episode the feeling that it gave you to rip the plastic off the tape you're holdin' peel it back yeah tear it off and play it what and swear to god four o'clock we'd crowd around the tv butter in his underwear and socks when naunie was kon artis yeah and proof had his hair in locs doody yeah back when flavor flav had us wearin' clocks back with back with ed lover yeah and there was two dr dre's that's a paradox pair of docs but i never thought i'd get so jealous at the thought of letting you go psychologically it's gonna bother me my eyes are already watery part of me don't wanna stop yeah 'til i get you back if i gotta put the work in and tell you i'm never givin' this up other part wants to tell you just to get fucked go back to whatever dick that you sucked ah get back together with them you slut givin' up the vagina like a trip to the gynecologist when i helped you become bigger than you were but i guess that it slipped your mind you must be biding your time looking for someone to come along that'll make you feel like i did back when you were mine huh damn but truthfully it was never really you and me exclusively and there's too many new mc's you can choose between but no matter how many motherfuckers ran through it they can't do it like me but i can't keep burnin' the candle at both ends and i can't handle it when i leave and you find another one now i gotta take this beat and dismantle it i won't grieve when i kill you but if i can't have you bitch nobody can can't believe i used to be your favorite bitch"
