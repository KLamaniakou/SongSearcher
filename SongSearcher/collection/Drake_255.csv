"Drake","Think Good Thoughts","drake yeah 9th wonder don't judge me man they tend to say that us rappers are materialistic they say we lack substance me 'te and el 'bout to prove 'em wrong though   drake ugh we know what you're thinking love you think we out smoking and drinking love pushing big whips chains clinking love but you don't really know me like you think you know me we know how you speculate thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date claim we early and be showing up extra late love but you don't really know me like you think you know me   drake they don't be saying how i'm humble i'm hella nice or that i've been approached to sign to rocafella twice they just tell you all the rumors they heard and we laugh soon as you come and tell me like amel and bryce my groove theory is that when you too cheery they try to bring you down to the level they at well when they are all unhappy then it gets a little sticky that's why i am little nicky to these devils in rap but uh they ain't thinking drake get smart girl nah they probably think i'll break your heart girl haha i can't lie you probably right about it and if you give me the ass quick i'll probably write about it but i hate it when they judge me on how i sound i mean i spit that influential shit from my town i don't know why you sitting on the couch when you see i got a bed bring your ass here and lie down you think taking your purse off will lead to me you taking shirts off and then your skirt off at least i got status because i could've been a local emcee and you probably would've been worse off so i'ma take this hat off and i'ma hit it till i'm back soft and then i backs off 'cause you thinking you can predict what happen you the reason i'm thinking i'm getting sick of rapping   drake ugh we know what you're thinking love you think we out smoking and drinking love pushing big whips chains clinking love but you don't really know me like you think you know me we know how you speculate thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date claim we early and be showing up extra late love but you don't really know me like you think you know me   phonte you probably think i walk around with my gun tucked and swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks well you can think what you want but i think you've been watching too much bet uncut you need to get real and check out my real life i ain't a tipdrill don't care what it smell like but if you feel like putting all your notions aside and talking to a real nigga i'd gladly oblige first name phonte i'd be pleased to date ya college educated got degrees in papers but i'm from the south where if you ain't snapping or rapping 'bout trapping you's a freak of nature such an anomaly speak so well and talk so collegy such an astonishing contrast to all the bullshit you've been following on behalf of them i offer my apologies maybe with me you'll unlearn putting all niggas in a box of concerns me 'cause i ain't dumb shit i'm wellread like sunburn and after me you'll never leave no stone unturned   drake ugh we know what you're thinking love you think we out smoking and drinking love pushing big whips chains clinking love but you don't really know me like you think you know me we know how you speculate thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date claim we early and be showing up extra late love but you don't really know me like you think you know me   elzhi yeah they say you never judge a book by its cover though you appear as materialistic just like the others so i followed your words to take 'em in and i don't see what you saying so they coming off paperthin that's when i felt that i would need to do more than just look you up and down to see if i could read you and try to get inside your head only not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me so what i learned on my path to discover your story took one ugly turn after another i saw we wasn't on the same page i would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way so now i'm closing the case you only out for the paperback that's written all over your face no el will never judge a book by its cover until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under   drake ugh we know what you're thinking love you think we out smoking and drinking love pushing big whips chains clinking love but you don't really know me like you think you know me we know how you speculate thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date claim we early and be showing up extra late love but you don't really know me like you think you know me"
