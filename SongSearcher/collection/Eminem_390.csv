"Eminem","Ghost Stories","uhhuh uhhuh yo alright yo  verse i'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while i'm sleeping i keep dreaming ofâ€…deathâ€…and i'm hearingâ€…people screaming the devil's spirit's trapped insideâ€…me and i want it out i'm on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house with both of my wrists slit i'm lifted up in the air and suspended in animation like someone's holding me there i'm feeling somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck while i choke on my own blood that i swallow and drown to death but i found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes tripping over od'd bodies of dead lushes bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red slushes doors open and close by themselves books fly off shelves curtains catch fire the house melts my skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters the wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters caught a piece of shrapnel in the adam's apple two cups of holy water and i'm looking at 'em half full but as soon as i go to touch 'em they turn into red rum it got silent then all these voices said come follow me into the gates of hell i heard 'em yell welcome to the norman bates motel i ring the bell for service and i was greeted by his mother covered in dry blood head still dented from the shovel i said i need a room so i could try to get some rest she gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess and told me that's just for starters satan'll be in to see me later to see if i'm interested in being partners"
