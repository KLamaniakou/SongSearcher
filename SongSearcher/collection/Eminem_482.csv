"Eminem","Rolling Stone Q/A Exclusive 2013","are you feeling good about the album at this point um that's a tough question man for the most part yeah but i don't know if i ever feel totally great about a record when i put it out with every record that i put out someone has literally got to come pry it from me because when i listen to my own music i just hear flaws in it like i hear 'oh fuck i could have done this better or that better' and i'll work it to death obviously if i wasn't comfortable with it i wouldn't put it out but from the beginning ever since my career started i don't know if i've ever been totally like this is completely it  in this last crunch what have you been working on i guess you would say last minute jitters of fuck are the vocals loud enough can you hear what i'm saying on this part is the beat right are the vocals too loud' if i could not have to mix any songs and just take the actual two tracks that i rapped over and put them out i would do that 'cause nothing ever feels the way as when you first did it  but you're not changing lyrics or anything like that it's just all mix and sound stuff it's just sonic shit that needs to be worked out for the most part because when i decide to keep a song that's pretty much it like if it doesn't work i pretty much know right away right when i get it in the car and take it home  rolling stone's review of eminem's the marshall mathers lp   so why did you dye your hair blonde again um i'll say that one was manager paul rosenberg's idea in the earlier stages of the record and developing this shit i had thought about it and once the songs started to come together and the picture got a little more clear of what it was gonna be he hit me with the idea and i was like yo you know i thought about that right and he was like well you know why not and i was like i don't know how it's gonna look i haven't had it in how many fucking years five six years i was like i'm so used to it being dark you know so i just tried it and i was like fuck it  did physically looking like that help you get back in the mindset or change the way you were recording not really honestly because i already had most of the songs and i don't know if i'm gonna keep it like this or how long i'm gonna keep it but for right now it is what it is and i feel like it may fit and maybe people will understand when they get the record  for recovery there was a lot of rejected stuff you recorded 00 songs or something or at least you had 00 beats so was there a lot of stuff thrown in the garbage pile this time around i feel like right now i'm probably working harder than i've ever worked in my life and i've probably worked harder on this record than any other record aside from maybe the time period during the eminem show which is a little hazy 'cause just so much shit was going on at that time just being so busy with the eminem show and doing the 8 mile movie and the soundtrack and the score to the movie this is probably the equivalent of that but all focused on the record mostly  that's crazy once i had the direction that i wanted to go and you know calling it the marshall mathers lp  obviously i knew that there might be certain expectations like i wouldn't want to just call it that just for the sake of calling it that so i wanted to make sure that i had the right songs to be able to call it that so a lot of recording a lot of songs that people probably will never hear we hit a couple of road blocks there were songs where the beat leaked or a producer sold the beat to someone else or whatever and just when you think you got it or you got the right amount of songs you go back and you listen and you're like fuck man i feel like it needs this or this to paint the whole picture  a lot of people maybe even you think the original is your best album it's probably my favorite i think some of them are my favorites for different reasons hate to even say that about my own record but i mean the first three records i think they may have captured a time period and then i think i pretty much probably have publicly said you know encore and relapse wasn't  it was just a different time  you've been hard on relapse but tyler the creator says that it's his favorite hiphop record in years he loves that record yeah he tells me that every time i see him i don't hate the record i want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically but at the same time find the right balance between that and making the right songs and you know i don't know if i necessarily found that balance yet because i was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like ha ha this is funny you know walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it because when i got sober it was like  i've said this before  but it just was like oh shit i can think straight again so i don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs writing songs that felt like something that brought some kind of emotion i ran accents into the ground i got stuck on that kind of serial killer crazy vibe and just kind of went with it  on recovery obviously the world came to you on that one how do you feel now about that record i feel like that record i finally got back to where i was at maybe during the eminem show like creatively and songwriting i guess i mean obviously recovery was the first time i had ever worked with that many producers outside of our camp aside from working with dre it was like i always wanted to produce my own records because producing is fun to me too one of the things that was cool for me about that record was getting beats that already had es on them it's kind of like a challenge to myself to be able to hear somebody else's hook and kind of interpret the words because my own hooks i already know what i mean when i write them the way that i do music is like regardless of what the beat is and whatever kind of appeal it may or may not have i always want to try to go as hard lyrically as i can so regardless if the beat feels like wow maybe this could be played on the radio i'm not like maybe radio would play this so i'll just wing it like i always have looked at it like i want to approach every record from an mcs' aspect  so how did you come to decide to designate this the sequel to the marshall mathers lp how did you decide to make your life miserable like that well here's what it is it's not necessarily a sequel  okay as much as it is a revisitation  like this is a different time period in my life so there's not gonna be like continuations of every song or anything like that to me it's more about the vibe and the nostalgia one of my favorite new things to do is experiment with new older breakbeats and sounds and shit like that you know retro shit and try to make it current like bring it up to date  so did seeking out rick rubin come from that direction you were like why don't i go back to the source paul had mentioned to me that he might be interested in doing it and he had been talking to him and i was like fuck man another thing with this record is that i kind of got back into producing more on recovery i wanted to focus more on writing and not have to worry abut making the beats on relapse i think it was mostly all dre so i kind of started producing again a little bit i was kind of in the middle of that when paul had mentioned that and was fucking around with those kind of sounds and i don't know if that's what made paul reach out to rick or if rick reached out to him but as soon as i heard he was interested i was like yo just let me finish this up and let's go see him  you've called rick yoda  was there still stuff to be learned from him at this point in your career yoda voice learning i did um yeah i mean the best part about rick's vibe is he's very zenlike in the sense of just let it happen the weird thing about it is nine times out 0 we would know instantly if something didn't work and it didn't feel right you know he's almost like a coach  he's very psychological right yeah the guy's got his shoes off laughs working with him is the most relaxed atmosphere he's not afraid to try anything i kind of felt in the same way i felt and still feel to this day as far as like wanting to impress dre we talked at his house and then i think we went straight to his studio from there and we started going through breakbeats i told him that i had started experimenting with some more retro sounds so we just sat down and started picking shit out and i would start writing to them and next time i'd get together with him we'd start adding shit to it the dude's got so many ideas man one of the coolest things about the sound that he gives you is the rick rubin scratches when he fucking scratches some shit it's almost like this perfect slop that it has on it not that it's offtime or anything like that but it's just like  it's fucking weird i don't even know how to explain it you just know that he scratched it i don't know if that even makes sense or not it's like a simple scratch like a basic kind of thing but it's so fucking dope when you hear it it's just it's vintage him and plus he knows what a lot of those sounds came from and shit  did he have all the old drum machines sitting around the studio oh he's got some shit in the stash yeah definitely  so much has changed in hiphop since you started producing  did you find the beats you were making on your own were influenced by newer stuff um not necessarily because like i feel like i just do whatever feels right obviously i pay attention to what's going on and what's out and keep my finger on that pulse but i don't ever want to be like or do like what anyone else is doing that's no offense to anyone else  basically if there are outside influences that are current you let that come in from the other producers but your shit is your shit yeah that's exactly it more currentsounding shit i leave to them and not that i don't feel like my shit sounds current but it's not the exact same thing and i think i've updated as well  on the new song legacy you're talking about yourself in detail as a kid what does it take to get back in that mindset at your age i always try to make my music relatable to the kid who people said he ain't shit or bullied or whatever it felt like one of them selfempowerment songs everybody i believe wants to show the world that one day i'm gonna be this one day i'm gonna be that everybody has goals aspirations or whatever and everybody has been at a point in their life where nobody believed in them like if you haven't been kicked or whatever if you never went through    tribulations tribulations and shit like that then you're perfect and fuck you anyways so everybody has been in that place where they just have been counted out or not even counted like you don't matter oh yeah i'm gonna show you so it was about incorporating that idea into the idea of my legacy  into what i leave behind when i'm gone and i always looked up to other rappers for the words that they gave me there's many many songs that got me through a lot of shit  i just love that you rhyme onyx with comics on that song i don't know if anyone will get this like this is supernerdy but the rhyming words in that song never change and that's just one of the things that i do to try to challenge myself i wanted to try to make a whole song where the rhyming words never changed  you've praised the beastie boys' evolution but it doesn't seem like you're going to have a the disrespect for women has got to be through moment i mean listen my sense of humor has certainly not gone away i realize that i'm an adult a grownass man and i don't know what i'll be doing a year from now 0 years from now but i don't think that my tongueincheekness will ever go away i guess it's just a part of my personality i always want to keep some type of element of fun to the music as well if one song is darker or talking about a sad subject i don't want to make a whole album of that of being a downer i don't want to make a whole album of being too uppity you gotta try and find that right balance and that's one of the things that the creative process was on this record as far as just experimenting in other words recording till i get it and if i record 00 fucking songs and i don't have what i feel like i need yet to make the body of work then i'm gonna keep going and keep recording  you've written a bunch of your own hooks and even sing some of them where does your sense of melody come from that's a good question i would want to say that it's stemming from early hiphop rappers used to fuck around all the time with melodies at least on the shit that i grew up on i don't know keys on a keyboard or what note this is or that is i can only hum something but i think it just comes from all the data that i've collected in my years of listening to music and you know fuck man i think that as hiphop started evolving there was more melody in it people were starting to sing hooks even like early slick rick  sings hey young world  those kind of things maybe i took it somewhere different at times i don't know  maybe it's just pure instinct honestly that's probably what it is i don't want that to sound like arrogant or nothing but i just don't know where i get that sense from you know what i'm saying i'm not a singer singer i just know what's in key and what's not  having kendrick lamar on your album did you have any concern that he might go in and try to upstage you i completely respect what kendrick does and the fact that he's in the same camp that he's on aftermath only made sense to me he came to detroit we kicked it for a few minutes you know and i felt the vibe of what he's like and everything and you know he's a super cool and super humble dude when we did that record i think that was actually a week or two before he did the to control  is there advice you would give him at this point i don't know if he needs advice he seems like he's got a really good head on his shoulders man he's very smart and you can tell by the way he put his album together for one he's like a hiphop head man he just loves hiphop and obviously the way that he did the control verse it was almost like if you get mad at him then you might look foolish he set it up so that you can't really get mad at a lot of that shit he said because it was what every other mc is already thinking or you should be thinking  fundamentally do you feel like a rap god or do you feel like an underdog i think everything switches back and forth from hour to hour day by day with me that whole rap god record pretty much from top to bottom is tongue in cheek so i mean do i want to feel like that maybe sometimes again it goes back to everybody who competitive raps and does this for just purely the sport of it wants to be the best again that's why kendrick's worked so well because he only said what every rapper's already thinking if you don't want to be the best then why are you rapping    read more
