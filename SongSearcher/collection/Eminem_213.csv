"Eminem","Lose Yourself (Original Demo Version)","yo if you could just for one minute or one split second in time forget everything everything that bothers you all your problems everything and follow me   if i was froze inside of a moment if i could capture time inside a capsule an hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand it passes through it if i can grasp it and just control what happens to it then i can trap it so no more time elapses through it if raps could do it maybe i could tap into it then i could try to channel it through cadillacs and buicks to transmit through 'em to make you put your ass into it and that's when you hit the roof because you can't sit through it your passions too much for you to not be dancin' to it and as you do it your movements become fast and fluent you're mashin' to it moshin' 'til you're black and bluish you're actin' foolish this music it has influenced you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion true it's chaotic but it's got your body movin' as a unit unitin' together tonight so make it last and you better just  hook lose yourself in this music this moment we own it we won't never let it go go you better move yourself 'cause tomorrow's ass can wait there is no time to sit there and procrastinate you better lose yourself in this music this moment we own it we won't never let it go go you better move yourself 'cause tomorrow's ass can wait there is no time to sit there and procrastinate you better   'cause we descend together we begin to move as one in perfect unison just like the moon and sun illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum rhythmically in sync if you'll excuse the pun but if you could lose it once i mean if you could let shit go relax take a breath and just let it exit slow to rest your soul you could leave the rest to me if i could give the world a hit of ecstasy to make 'em feel the feelin' that i'm feelin' right this minute 'cause i feel like the night won't end until i get finished so close the shades makin' sure no light gets in it the sky's the limit tonight because the night's infinite a high percentage of black people and white mixed in it but no one really gives a fuck 'cause they just like what's spinnin' his life was spinnin' the whole entire night just spinnin' like life's beginning to come out from inside your skin and quit hidin' in it  hook lose yourself in this music this moment we own it we won't never let it go go you better move yourself 'cause tomorrow's ass can wait there is no time to sit there and procrastinate you better lose yourself in this music this moment we own it we won't never let it go go you better move yourself 'cause tomorrow's ass can wait there is no time to sit there and procrastinate you better"
