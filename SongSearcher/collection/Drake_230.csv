"Drake","These Days","i've been out walking i don't do too much talking these days these days these days i seem to think a lot about the things that i forgot to do  hook these days   i've met some women i wish i had resisted these days these days these days i seem to think about how i have failed to change all of my ways  hook these days   yeah i had a lover don't think i'd risk another these days these days and if i seem to be afraid just listen to the life i've made in songs  hook these days  4 i've stopped the dreaming i don't do too much scheming these days these days i sit inside a chauffeur car with windows down and count the stars these days these days"
