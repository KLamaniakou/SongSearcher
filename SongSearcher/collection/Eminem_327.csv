"Eminem","My Drug Addiction","i don't know what point exactly it started to be a problem i just remember liking it more and more whenever people would try to help me i would say get that fucking person outta here i can't believe they said that shit to me they don't know anything about me or my life it's not like i'm out here snorting coke or shooting heroin up my arm  it's either you have a problem and can you control it or you can't i literally thought i could control it until i overdosed during christmas of 007 had i got to the hospital about two hours later i would have died my organs were shutting down my liver kidneys everything they were gonna have to put me on dialysis they didnt think i was gonna make it  i remember coming out of rehab and relapsing and shooting right back up to where i was when i overdosed i was ransacking my whole house just looking for a stash of vicodin that i maybe hidden away and then i found some in my basement wrapped up it was the extra strength ones  after i got out of rehab i did not sleep for three week straights i mean like not even nodding off for a fucking minute i would just sit up and stare at my tv  i would walk around my house and thinking every single day i'm gonna fucking die i'm looking at my kids and like i need to be here for them i'm growing i just couldnt believe that anybody could be naturally happy or naturally function or be just enjoying life in general without being on something  the doctors told me i'd done the equivalent of four bags of heroin i was addicted valium ambien the numbers got so high i didn't even know what i was taking anymore it never once hit me that drug addiction runs in my family now that i understand that im an addict i definitely have compassion for my mother i get it now  i wanted to make an overall statement  im back it was a slow process you gotta remember i hadnt recorded a song sober in seven years so it took me a while to even feel like i could record a song sober  i dont know the last time i shot a video sober without drinking or taking anything its been years  i almost feel like a little kid again with rap i wanna play around with different flows if i dont feel like its what im fully capable of if theres one weak line i wanna change it rap was my drug it used to get me high and then it stopped getting me high then i had to resort to other things to make me feel that now raps getting me high again  so i would say to anybody it does get better you know it just does"
