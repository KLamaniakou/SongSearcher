"Eminem","Public Service Announcement (2006)","spoken eminem public service announcement and another annoying message from slim shady due to a massive amount of bootlegging no thanks to this fucking guy dj whoo kid and constant downloading people are no longer buying cds so that we can get paid for our fucking work they are just continuing to get songs for free teenagers older folks and little fucking brats alike see what they do is buy computers strictly pick songs that they like and burn them on cds or put them on ipods causing major decrease in sound scan putting music retail in a tremendous slump causing artists such as myself to make no money for record sales and be forced to tour causing more stress arguments with my wife not being able to see my kids drink more take more pills punch more people in the face hate the world and end up in rehab this has been a public service announcement and an excuse to vent by marshall mathers not that i wouldn't have done the same thing if i could get music for free when i was a kid but now that i rap for a living buy my goddamn cds but in the meantime buy this obie trice bootleg from dj whoo kid and put more money in his pocket thanks"
