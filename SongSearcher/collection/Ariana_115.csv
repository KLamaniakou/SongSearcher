"Ariana Grande","The Wizard and I (Live)","when i meet the wizard once i prove my worth and when i meet the wizard what i've waited for since since birth and with all his wizard wisdom by my looks he won't be blinded do you think the wizard is dumb or like munchkins so smallminded no he'll say to me i see who you truly are a girl on whom i can rely and that's how we'll begin the wizard and i  once i'm with the wizard my whole life will change cause once you're with the wizard no one thinks you're strange no father is not proud of you no sister acts ashamed and all of oz has to love you when by the wizard you're acclaimed and this gift or this curse i have inside maybe at last i'll know why when we are hand in hand the wizard and i  one day he'll say to me elphaba a girl who is so superior shouldn't a girl who's so good inside have a matching exterior and since folks here to an absurd degree seem fixated on your verdigris would it be alright by you if i degreenify you and though of course that's not important to me all right why not i'll reply oh what a pair we'll be the wizard and i yes what a pair we'll be the wizard and  unlimited my future is unlimited and i've just had a vision almost like a prophecy i know it sounds truly crazy and true the vision's hazy but i swear someday there'll be a celebration throughout oz that's all to do with me  and i'll stand there with the wizard feeling things i've never felt and though i'd never show it i'd be so happy i could melt and so it will be for the rest of my life and i'll want nothing else 'til i die held in such high esteem when people see me they will scream for half of oz's favorite team oh the wizard and i"
