"Eminem","Asshole","eminem came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain an asshole that role i think i succeeded fulfillin' but don't think i ever stopped to think that i was speakin' to children everything was happenin' so fast it was like i blinkedsold three million then it all went blank all i remember is feelin' ridiculous cause i was gettin' sick of this feelin' like i'm always under attack man i could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin' women dishin' but really thinkin' if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him guess i'm a little bit of a hypocrite when i'm rippin' shit but since when did this many people ever give a shit what i had to say it's just my opinion if it contradicts how i'm livin' put a dick in your rear end that's why every time you mentioned a lyric i thanked you for it for drawin' more attention toward it cause it gave me an enormous platform i'm flattered you thought i was that important but you can't ignore the fact that i fought for the respect and battled for it mad awards had glaad annoyed attaboy they told me to slow down i'd just zone out good luck tryin' to convince a blonde it's like tellin' gwen stefani she sold out cause i was tryna leave no doubt in anyone's mind one day i'd go down in history think they know now because everybody knows   skylar grey everybody knows that you're just an asshole everywhere that you go people wanna go home everyone knows everybody knows so don't pretend to be nice there's no place you can hide you are just an asshole everyone knows everyone knows  interlude eminem thanks for the support asshole scratch thanks for the support asshole   eminem quit actin' salty i was countin' on you to count me out ask asher roth when he roundabout dissed me to shout me out thought i was history well goddamn honky that compliment's like backhandin' a donkey good way to get your ass socked in the mouth nah i'm off him but what the fuck's all this trashtalkin' about the fight was fixed i'm back and you can't stop me you knocked me down i went down for the count i fell but the fans caught me and now you're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me to take my beltword to pacquiao momma said there ain't nothin' else to talk about better go in that ring and knock 'em out or you better not come out it's poetry in motion like freddie roach when he's quotin' shakespeare so what if insults are revoltin' even helen keller knows life stinks you think it's a joke 'til you're bulletriddled but you should give little shit what i think this whole world is a mess gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest and a glock just to go watch batman who needs to test a testicles not that man half of you don't got the guts intestinal blockage rest of you got lap bands stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts and all those water bottles in colorado so get lost waldo my soul's escapin' through this asshole that is gapin' a black hole and i'm swallowin' this track whole better pack toilet paper but i'm takin' no crap ho here i go down the bat pole and i'm changin' back into that old maniac in fact there they go tryna dip out the back door retreatin' cause

we had some magnetic pull then screamed icp in this bitch how do fuckin' magnets work cause you're attractive but we ain't attractable hate to be dramatical but i'm not romantical i'm makin' up words so you can understandable it's tragical thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen that ain't practical you crackin' a joke it's laughable cause me and love's like a bad combination i keep them feelings locked in a vault so it's safe to say i'm uncrackable my heart is truly guarded full body armor bitch you just need a helmet cause if you think you're special you're retarded thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina you're a train wreck i got a onetrack mind shorty you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor been tryna hunt me down like a dog cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent cause all of my spare time is spent on my nose in this binder so don't bother tryin' only women that i love are my daughters but sometimes i rhyme and it sounds like i forget i'm a father and i push it farther so father forgive me if i forget to draw the line it's apparent i shouldn't have been a parent i'll never grow up so to hell with your parents and motherfuck father time it ain't never gonna stop a pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime so even if i'm halfdead i'm halfalive poured my halfempty glass in a cup now my cup has runneth over and i'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster im goin' back to what got me here yeah cocky and cant knock bein' rude off so fear not my dear and dry up your teardrops i'm here white america's mirror so don't feel awkward or weird if you stare at me and see yourself because you're one too shouldn't be a shock because everybody knows   skylar grey everybody knows that you're just an asshole everywhere that you go people wanna go home everyone knows everybody knows so don't pretend to be nice there's no place you can hide you are
