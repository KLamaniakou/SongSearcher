'cause i said motherfuck school and instead went to special ed sippin' bacardi and lime i start to recollect on the time that i startled my mom and had her scared to death word to method man she heard some wutang coming from towards the patio she was like what the heck was that she went to check on the noise and go inspect the deck then i jumped out with a sword and yelled protect your neck now bow to the lord hold up no better yet kneel better yet get down on all fours and take a vow to always rejoice in the sound of my voice but you don't have a choice just a third of my will will overpower yours using about a fourth to create the amount of force it'll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of tylenol enter my house of horrors with a thousand floors got a crown of thorns but it won't fit around the horns but i'ma keep it a buck like a dollar store i'm more than you bargained for and i am far more worse than a fortysome bar lord jamar verse nothing means more than respect so

bin rented to store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin' distorted twisted this isn't no storybook ending this is only the beginning so lord forgive me i'm hearing voices i can't
