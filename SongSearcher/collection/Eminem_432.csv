"Eminem","Ode To Detroit","detroit  there is a resilience that rises from somewhere deep within your streets  you can't define it but you can feel it  you can feel it overflowing from the people who call you home  from people who are always proud to declare 'i'm from detroit'  you took our country from it's infancy into industry  and your name still carries with it the idea of a nation built on steel muscle and sweat  you became the city that carried the country  the city like the sport is built on dreams  people who arrived here driven to excel  who know nothing is accomplished without hardwork without sacrifice  when you hurt we hurt  your streets witness our struggle  your bricks are our rage through the emptiness of each house shuttered of each factory closed  we've lived through the ups and the downs  but we remain detroit  we can never turn our backs on you detroit because we are you  my home  the home of motown cadillac and joe louis  through all this we cannot be defeated because we have never been defeated  you've built us you've moved us you've shaped us  sometimes down but never out  take strength in us your people  stay up detroit"
