gotta live it to feel it you didn't you wouldn't get it or see what the big deal is why it was and it still is to be walkin' this borderline of detroit city limits it's different it's a certain significance a certificate of authenticity you'd never even see but it's everything to me it's my credibility you never seen heard smelled or met a real mc who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me but yet i'm still unsigned havin' a rough time sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes go to work and serve mcs in the lunchline but when it comes crunch time where do my punchlines go who must i show to bust my flow where must i go who must i know or am i just another crab in the bucket cause i ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot fuck it maybe i need a new outlet i'm startin' to doubt shit i'm feelin' a little skeptical who i hang out with i look like a bum yo my clothes ain't about shit at the salvation army tryna salvage an outfit and it's cold tryna travel this road plus i feel like i'm always stuck in this battlin' mode my defenses are so up but one thing i don't want is pity from no one this city is no fun there is no sun and it's so dark sometimes i feel like i'm just bein' pulled apart from each one of my limbs by each one of my friends it's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin sometimes i feel like a robot sometimes i just know not what i'm doin' i just blow my head is a stove top i just explode the kettle gets so hot sometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that i don't got but i've learned it's time for me to uturn yo it only takes one time for me to get burned ain't no fallin' no next time i meet a new girl i can no longer play stupid or be immature i got every ingredient all i need is the courage like i already got the beat all i need is the words got the urge suddenly it's a surge suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred time to show these free world leaders the three and a third i am no longer scared now i'm free as a bird then i turn and cross over the median curb hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 mile road   i'm a man gotta make a new plan it's alright it's okay time for me to just stand up and travel new land i'm gonna make it anyway time for me to just take matters into my own hands gonna make it can't give up now once i'm over these tracks man i'ma never look back i'ma make it somehow 8 mile road and i'm gone i know right where i'm goin' it's alright it's okay sorry momma i'm grown i must travel alone i'm gonna make it anyway ain't gon' follow no footsteps i'm makin' my own gonna make it can't give up now only way that i know how to escape from this 8 mile road i'ma make it somehow"
