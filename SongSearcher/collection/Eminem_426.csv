"Eminem","Verse 3","its like this and like that and like this x   i'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless patrolling corners looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters i'm meaner in action than roscoe beating james todd sr and smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments i grew up in the wild hood as a hazardous youth with a fucked up childhood that i used as an excuse and ain't shit changed but kept the same mindstate since the third time that i failed ninth grade you probably think that i'm a negative person don't be so sure of it i don't promote violence i just encourage it i laugh at the sight of death as i fall down a cement flight of steps and land inside a bed of spider webs so throw caution to the wind you and a friend can jump off of a  and if you live do it again shit why not blow your brain out i'm blowing mine out fuck it you only live once you might as well die now"
