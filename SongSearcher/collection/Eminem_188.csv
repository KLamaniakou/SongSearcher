"Eminem","Right for Me","i feel phenomenal as usual pharmaceuticals glue sniffin' pools of vomit at bonnaroo but i don't know if i'm in tennessee chicago or houston in the corner tryin' to seek solitude shallow but such a hollow dude i won't even swallow solid food alcoholic too plus i'm on lean like the tower of pisa top it off i'm on mushrooms so fuck all of you roses are violet mollies are blue lost in a ball of confusion it's all an illusion it's probably the shrooms i'm on cause i think i started hallucinating cause i just thought i heard jay electronica and odd future's new shit and all i could do was follow the music and end up with paula abdul at lollapalooza fillin' water balloons with nailpolish remover just to pop 'em and wallow in fumes i feel uptight i gotta get looser after i finish polishing off this bottle of booze i got a solution concentrated like orange juice so i'm not as deluded cause all this delusion got me seein' shit excusezmoi but that hoochie that passed you see her ass wouldn't make her my main squeeze butt juicier ass it belongs in a juicer it's mouthwaterin' too so i walked over to her like im marshall wanna try to meet my standards i'll duce ya oh i'm a misogynist too but i'm not a masseuse but my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth uh chronic abuser and i don't mean a user of marijuana i mean verbal assault that i use to smoke all of you losers got a bazooka a shotgun a ruger a glock and a nuke and a rottweiler too and i'm not in the mood so when i say i'm bringing the tec out i'm not coming to repair your fuckin' electronic computers god i'm gonna puke i'm so gone off the hookah i think i swallowed a loofah i'm tore up demolished i'm fuckin' stoned like oliver like i looked medusa in the eyeball to seduce her the thoughts i produce are loony tunes the box of reusable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes that were placed next to veronica's boobs and the paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box in a blue honda with used condoms were clues the girl was just not the one suitable for him  hook right for me that will change me rearrange my head to be just right for you and me dont laugh please listen to me   thought id give in to the pressure collapse and crumble perhaps relapsing under that well that's a bunch of crap in the clutch i'm the captain crunch of rap and i'm sick of acting humble that's enough of that fuck that shit cut the sack like it's a natural reaction that's why i'm actually trapped in this shoving match cause push keeps coming to that i can keep getting my ass kicked and coming back like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit still mad disgruntled had some struggles yeah but that passion and hunger's back what a fantastic juggling act and the way i flip my tongue on the track it's like verbal acrobatics but in fact last time i tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic i fuckin' crashed my hovercraft after i strapped a duffel bag to my back and stuffed a massive punchin' bag in it and an elastic bungee strap rubber plaster a thumb tack and a piece of plastic bubble wrap went spastic and fuckin' snapped jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid stumbled back recovered back flipped and landed on a gymnastic tumble mat and for my last trick lunge on back latch on a nasa shuttle flap fuckin' snap the rudder in half chuckled and laughed utter my last rebuttal and just as i'm to come crashin' i grab my gogogadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress and ceramic construction hat rub my magic mushroom tat for luck then splat get up from that face taped to a waste paper basket throw up then gasp lungs collapsed and that's more likely than finding someone that's  hook right for me that will change me rearrange my head to be just right for you and me dont laugh please listen to me   couple of shots of jÃ¤ger public intoxication disfuckin'combobulation flooded with thoughts of anger while i was away i know probably some of you got to

nameless whatever your job is i give a fuck what's your occupation you're thinkin' just cause you came in with scrubs and you brought the scalpel and sponge the oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon stuck in the operating room once you done swapped your name with him smuggled in ronald reagan if you dug him up donald fagen while juggling waffles bacon a fuckin' mcdonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagled it flung it across the table then bump it and knock it shake it jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration i said fuck it and lost my patience they all woke up from sedation ain't none of you dr dre so then what is it got you thinkin' you can fuck with this operation aftermath still running hiphop amazin' i'm still pluggin' along no need for an assumption here's confirmation i'm up for the long duration i'm just looking for something to walk away with some pocket change and a little integrity though i'll probably be jumpin' across the stage 'til i'm fuckin' madonna's age and stuck in an awkward place in my life but i shit you not like i'm plugged up with constipation that day will come before i finally stumble upon some lady thats  hook right for me that will change me rearrange my head to be just right for you and me dont laugh please listen to me"
