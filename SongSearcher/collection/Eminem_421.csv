"Eminem","Mic Check One Two","let's just go man is it recording yeah let's just rhyme out our ass bout to kick a rhyme right outta my head mic check one two mic check one two mic check one two   here i go in the place to be rhyming like this on the mic here's the way that i rhyme so naturally and actually when i grab the mic all the people say mm you're one of the funkiest mc's out today and i say i agree because i am a funky dope slamming mc i slam them back daddy eveytime i grab the mic and say i wanna rap daddy but you can't because i take it grab the mic and after i'm done i break it when i'm done i just slam the microphone and cram it right in your asshole because 'asshole' and 'cram the' didn't rhyme but that's alright 'cause i'm jamming on the microphone 'cause i'm slamming busting out lyrics and you like to examine my style that i'm doing but if you step to me pursuing i'll ruin all your hopes and dreams 'cause i work with my man he's on my team my man manix is on my side every time the  they say damn how'd you make a beat like that ma'am and i say i'm not a ma'am i'm a sir and if you step to me your eyes'll be blurred   one two one two mic checka one two one two one two mic checka check one two mic checka one two one two mic check three four six seven eight   mic check one two do unto others as you would have them do to you no that's not the way i work because when i rhyme i'm a jerk i grab the mic and start dissing all these mc's and try to put them into submission take them out for the count because the amount i throw is so deaf word deaf didn't rhyme but i on your windshield just like a turd every time that i rhyme you know that i'm going to climb to the tip tip top and i'm not going to stop 'cause i grab the mic and dopda dop dop i fucked up but that's alright because my luck's up no it's not 'cause here i am i got a lot to give and i don't live positive now i'm not saying i'm negative but if i grab the mic i do mega kits every time that i grab the mic you know that mm is gonna be rolling his tongue just like this and then i go do a funky rhyme and if any mc steps up he gets fucking dissed bad don't call me dad vanilla ice said that that made me mad so when i step to the mic know that i gotta clear my throat and excite i'm trying to get the mic cord away from the stereo so i can bust some material i take it around my leg and then all the mc's wanna beg and say yo please give me a turn i say no because it's my turn to burn and i bust a rhyme like this and you can't step to a rhyme that i do 'cause you're dissed you're dissed so bad every time sure he don't get a turn and he's starting to get mad but i'm just going to take the mic i'm not gonna give it to him because i am so damn hyped in the place to be rhyming like this 'cause i'm an mc rhyming so deaf to the happy ass beat it's kinda gay like liberace but hey listen to the words that i display every time i kick a rhyme this way you know that the star is worthwhile every time i grab the mic i'm longer than i mile   i waste no time when i can't flip i caper i cut your butt up like g floyd like paper when i bust a rhyme i'm a stud that's what i like to say jump on my pud girly girly would you like to fuck me fuck me in my house early or late i don't care let's make a date 'cause i don't pump weights to get dates just because i'm huge i bust a lyric but i get greedy like a scrooge when i grab the mic it's kinda stingy i kick rhymes that ain't dingy when i bust i'm like forcillin you try to grab the mic and force it again but you can't 'cause you are speechless and i get sandy like teachers i get sandy i grab the mic handy it's so i can get candy when i bust the shit i get like a noogie then i boogie boogie on down because every time that i kick a rhyme i just 'dud' i meant to say 'do' but i got an addiction to friction every time i kick nonfiction nonfiction science every time i grab the mic i got the alliance right behind me stepping into the 90's you know you'll try me and you'll die g so don't even try it i don't buy it so you'd better keep quiet 'cause you're into it ain't nothing but to do it  4 you'd better catch up 'cause you're trailing you'd better put springs in your ass and jump like van halen every time i bust a rhyme i get like a panther if you're lying that slander 'cause you're lying like berry saunders every time i grab the mic i get married and i like to kick a rhyme that i pick every time i pick the mic up i stick a dick right up your ass like a faggot you're gonna die be crawling with maggots every time i dread you like hair i said you'd better get  on your underwear you'd better run 'cause if you don't afraid you'll be seeing a ghost like a rake you ain't an eighth of me every time i grab the mic girls try to act so faithfully but i say no don't be a fan just try to step to my dick and act like a man no that don't make no sense but every time  i cut class like a pair of scissors i get so damn hyped on the mic 'cause every time i step to the forefront i like to wonder on to something that i'm drawn to every time i grab the mic and pass it to sean he gets so deaf but i'm not gonna pass it yet 'cause i burn like acid vet word i'm a stick like a trident 'cause you need guidance"
