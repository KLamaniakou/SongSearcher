for four hours and you just said no that's pretty crummy man you're like his favorite idol he wants to be just like you man he likes you more than i do i ain't that mad though i just don't like being lied to remember when we met in denver you said if i'd write you you would write back see i'm just like you in a way i never knew my father neither he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her i can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs so when i have a crumby day i drift away and put 'em on cause i don't really got shit else so that shit helps when i'm depressed i even got a tattoo of your name across the chest sometimes i even cut myself to see how much it bleeds it's like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me see everything you say is real and i respect you cause you tell it my girlfriend's jealous cause i talk about you 47 but she don't know you like i know you slim no one does she don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up you gotta call me man i'll be

eminem dear stan i meant to write you sooner but i just been busy you said your girlfriend's pregnant nowhow far along is she look i'm really flattered you would call your daughter that and here's an autograph for your brother i wrote it on a starter cap i'm sorry i didn't see you at the show i must've missed you don't think i did that shit intentionally just to diss you but what's this stuff you said about you like to cut your wrists too i say that stuff just clownin' dawg come on how messed up is you you got some issues stan i think you need some counselin' to help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some and what's this junk about us meant to be together that type of crap'll make me not want us to meet each other i really think you and your girlfriend need each other or maybe you just need to treat her better i hope you get to read this letter i just hope it reaches you in time before you hurt yourself i think that you'll be doin' just fine if you relax a little i'm glad i inspire you but stan why are you so mad try to understand that i do want you as a fan i just don't want you to do some crazy shit i seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick some dude was drunk and drove his car over a  and had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid and in the car they found a tape but they didn't say who it was to come to think about it his name was it was you damn"
