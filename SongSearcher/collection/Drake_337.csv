"Drake","Try Harder","drake sometimes i feel like lohan and hilary duff are the only ones with enough to feel what i'm about to say in this song when they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself and you do it and get the feeling it's wrong that there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping and they try to make you out as a lie it's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason it's a lose lose why even try when your ideas so frequently get rejected people just get neglected and they never really know how to feel phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics and the motives to try and make them a mill you never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and they just wanna say that you ain't around i mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming that you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town   x4 you gonna try to try harder cuz try harder cuz try trytrytry   drake and the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher than most of these rappers running the game certain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash there's time i would have done it the same i mean i got me a range also got me a guilty conscience that made you tell anybody i meet that i rent sometimes i wish that i would just chilled on the sneakers and watched the game from the bleachers because i'm really tend to need what i spent in a house that i promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time i wasted out late at the club instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner i'm working hard on the winter so this album is a labor of love you say as long as i'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats that she can rest without a toss and a turn because she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on tv that's exactly why i often get burned but i'm gonna try to   x4"
