a cyclops like it's the only one i only one eye got and my thoughts are like nines cocked chkchk every line's obscene pervertedest mind got the dirtiest rhyme stocked that's why there's parental advising visine every time i drop eye drop so throw on the theme to alfred i'll channel him like the panama canal but how could i get up in arms about you saying trash is all that i put out bitch i still get the bag when i'm putting garbage out plus the potty mouth i'm not about to wash it out the filthiest so all this talk about i'm washed up how preposterous because if cleanliness is next to godliness it's obvious that it's impossible for me to be beside myself and i'm 'bout that capital like a proper noun still on top the pile got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial quick to call you out on your bullshit don't make me give that crock a dial 'cause if i do it see you later alligator made it out the trailer then i made a vow to cater to no one so hate i've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account so here's some more shit for you to complain about i say the bars that never slack yeah but always get attacked yeah i think they're gunnin' for me it's startin' to feel like that like i'm marked 'cause when i rap it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit 'cause i have this target on my back ew yuck but if i ever doublecrossed my fans and lost my stans i'd probably pop five xans yeah go in my garage start my van inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust i can and doze off like snores but odds like that with these thoughts i have's like a giant getting squashed by ants if this is the test of time i'd pass with flying colors like i just tossed my crayons tossed my crayons small medium and large size cans sanitizers of all types brands cost nine bands which is a small price for lysol wipes and if my palms brush across my pants i wash my hands  interlude shit hold on man motherfucker happy birthday to fuck shh quiet   i sit in silence in candlelit environments sipping wild irish while getting violent homicidal visions when i'm spitting like this but really i'm just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes which is really childish and silly but i'm really like this i'm giving nightmares to billie eilish i'm diddy's side bitch  interlude what the fuck hold on wait i'm diddy's side bitch oh i'm still east side bitch   so 'til the end since epmd

love that's a dirty word make me fall in it there's not a girl on earth or any other planet that's a world of hurt and i won't buy a designer 'cause i don't pander panda but i'm back with so many knots i need a chiropractor damn and this the final chapter why 'cause i'm either frying after oh or they gon' give me the needle what like a vinyl scratcher dj yeah i'm a card like hallmark at walmart with a small cart buying wall art and y'all who claim to be dogs aren't no bite like a tree mostly just all bark arf arf but y'all pickin' the wrong tree they call me dog because i'm barking bar king bark bark barking and i got a lot yeah like where cars park i'd describe it as bowling why ball hard ball's hard 'cause the gutter's where my mind is and when it's in this frame better split like the five and the ten 'cause without a second to spare i'm strikin' again and when the beat is up my alley i go right for the pens pins the cypher begins i'm talkin' smack like heroin the mic's a syringe it's like a binge vicodin i would liken to tin my mind is a recycling bin there's no place i never been but i never budge and i never bend you hyperextend on me this game's life it depends like adult diapers for men even when i'm rappin' less stellar it's sour grapes i still whine i'm the best seller cellar like a trey deuce spray you as these shots penetrate through dre's booth and go straight through your grapefruit no escape route so you won't leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds your ass is grass and i am not gonna graze you but if bars were semimac's i'd be the mad hatter 'cause i got so many caps and you don't have any straps nah so you'd be a fitted yeah so don't act like you fittin' to snap bitch i'll pee p on your head like a phillies hat haha no stoppin' me
