what a pooh butt day is  4 mm now a pooh butt day is something everybody's had no particular depression neither mad or sad you couldn't see your butt because your butt is what it is cause when your feeling like a pooh butt then you're feeling like shit they come up at a certain time they don't have a season but most of the time you feel like one for no particular reason they get a careless attitude the yucky sensations some people won't accept love in a poohy situation sittin' on the toilet for an hour or so marks on the butt from the seat or the bowl grab a toilet paper and the seat and just wipe when i realize i may have sat the in the seat too tight so i shrug and shake from a stuck position but removing myself was an impossible mission screaming to get out i couldn't take it any more when my mother arrived and knocked upon the door we pulled and pulled and i was removed from the seat i couldn't sit down for a whole damn week never again will i get caught in that rut so i can stay fresh instead of feeling like a pooh but  hook mm sometimes things just never go my way you know ii just feel like a pooh butt today sometimes things just never go my way you know ii just
